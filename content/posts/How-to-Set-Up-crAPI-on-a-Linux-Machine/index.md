[crAPI](https://owasp.org/www-project-crapi/) (Completely Ridiculous API) is an intentionally vulnerable API that can be used to learn about and practice API security. It is an open-source project by [Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP](https://owasp.org/)[)](https://owasp.org/), designed around the ten most critical [API](https://owasp.org/www-project-api-security/) security risks.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up crAPI on a Linux machine.

# Prerequisite 

To follow along in this tutorial, you must have the following:

- Basic knowledge of the terminal.
- Linux machine â€” This article uses Kali distribution

# Setting up crAPI

To set up crAPI, you create a directory called `labs` in your home directory.


    cd ~
    mkdir labs
    cd labs

Next, you need to clone the crAPI application by running the following command:


    git clone https://github.com/OWASP/crAPI.git

Before you can run the application, you need to install `docker.io` and `docker-compose`. To do that, run the following command in your terminal:


    #installing docker.io
    sudo apt install docker.io
    #installing docker-compose 
    sudo apt install docker-compose

Note: if you get the `unable to fetch some archives` error, run the command: `sudo apt update --fix-missing`. Then run the docker.io and docker-compose command one more time.

Now, you can navigate to the crAPI directory:


    cd ~/labs/crAPI/deploy/docker

Next, you can spin up the application by running the following command:


    sudo docker-compose up

Finally, you can view the application in your browser by visiting `localhost:8888`

crAPI also comes with a mail server, which can be accessed by visiting `localhost:8025`
