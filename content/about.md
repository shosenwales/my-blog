Hi there!

My name is Shuaib and it seems that you’ve found your way over to my blog. Here I write about tech tricks, web application security , bug bounty write up's and other things related to technology that I find interesting.

I’m an ethical hacker and technical writer from Nigeria and I’m currently seeking entry-level cybersecurity roles. My certifications include CEH & eJPT. I love volunteering and I’m interested in all things technology.
